# Insurance Plan Highlights

Coverage for 117 disease conditions: We offer protection against 117 disease conditions, including 56 Major Disease Conditions and 61 Early Stage Major Disease Conditions. The plan covers most common disease conditions, including cancer, heart attack, and stroke.

If the person covered by the policy (the “life assured”) is diagnosed with one of the covered Major Disease Conditions, we will pay a lump sum of up to 100% of the current sum assured as the Major Disease Benefit; or we will pay this amount as a Death Benefit if the life assured unfortunately passes away.

400% extra coverage against Cancer, Heart Attack, and Stroke – even after a major disease claim: Although treatment today is better than ever, critical illnesses can strike again, causing a serious financial impact. Even after we have paid the Major Disease Benefit, the plan still covers the life assured if they are unfortunately diagnosed with Cancer, Heart Attack, or Stroke. You can claim up to 2 times for Cancer and up to 2 times for a combination of Heart Attack or Stroke before the life assured reaches age 86 (age next birthday [ANB]). We will pay 100% of the current sum assured each time as an Extended Major Disease Benefit, up to a total of 400% of the current sum assured of your PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III.

Multiple claims on Major Disease Conditions before age 86 (ANB): First claim - Major Disease Benefit (coverage: whole-life) + Extended Major Disease Benefit (coverage: up to age 86 [ANB]). Total benefit payout = 500% protection.

Waiting period for Extended Major Disease Benefit: at least 1 year between the dates of diagnosis of any 2 Major Disease Conditions; or at least 3 years when both preceding admitted and subsequent Major Disease Benefit or Extended Major Disease Benefit claims are for Cancer. Subsequent Cancer claims under the Extended Major Disease Benefit can be for new or continued Cancer, including recurrent, metastatic, and persistent Cancer.

# A Stronger Safety Net for Cancer

What happens if the Cancer unfortunately recurs or persists during the 3-year waiting period for Cancer? As soon as 1 year after the date of diagnosis of each preceding Cancer which we have paid the Major Disease Benefit or Extended Major Disease Benefit, we will offer the Cancer Treatment Extra Benefit.

We will pay an extra 60% of the current sum assured of your PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III, before the life assured reaches age 86 (ANB), as long as they are still suffering from Cancer and receiving active treatment or end-of-life care for Cancer. This needs to be within each of the following periods:

1. At least 1 year but less than 2 years after the date of diagnosis of the preceding Cancer claim.
2. At least 2 years but less than 3 years after the date of diagnosis of the preceding Cancer claim.

| |1 year|1 year|1 year|1 year|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Policy starts|60%|60%|60%|60%|
| |protection|protection|protection|protection|

Multiple Cancer claims before age 86 (ANB) provide 100% protection. Assuming the Major Disease Benefit claim is for Cancer, together with the Extended Major Disease Benefit for Heart Attack or Stroke mentioned above, we will provide critical illness protection of up to a total of 860% of the current sum assured of your PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III.

# Extended Protection Beyond Critical Illnesses

You never know what’s around the next corner. Whether it is a global pandemic or a health issue beyond critical illnesses, you could need the 24-hour intensive care programme that an ICU offers. That is why this plan also covers the life assured for ICU treatment if needed.

If the life assured needs to stay in the ICU for 3 or more consecutive days, we will pay up to 20% of the current sum assured of your PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III as an Intensive Care Benefit. We will only pay the Intensive Care Benefit once.

If the life assured is admitted to an ICU outside of Hong Kong or Macau, we will adjust the benefit amount to up to 10% of the current sum assured of PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III.

Protection for early stage major disease conditions, including pre-cancerous conditions. We will pay a percentage of the current sum assured of your PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III for Early Stage Major Disease Conditions, the amount of which depends on the diagnosed condition.

## Highlights:

- ICU treatment coverage
- Intensive Care Benefit up to 20% of sum assured
- Additional protection for major disease claims
- Option to convert Critical Illness Care Enhancer III to a new life insurance plan

## Risks:

Amount claimed for Early Stage Major Disease Benefit will be deducted from subsequent Major Disease Benefit, Death Benefit, or Surrender Value.

If you do not make any claims under the plan, you can convert your Critical Illness Care Enhancer III to a new life insurance plan without the need for additional health information.

# Insurance Plan Details

# Insurance Plan Details

## What happens to my cover after I have claimed the Major Disease Benefit?

After the Major Disease Benefit claim, you do not need to pay any more premiums for your plan, and the life assured is still covered by the Extended Major Disease Benefit and the Cancer Treatment Extra Benefit.

You can make 2 further claims for Cancer and also 2 further claims for a combination of Heart Attack or Stroke up to age 86 (ANB) under the Extended Major Disease Benefit.

We keep protecting the life assured with the Cancer Treatment Extra Benefit if their Cancer unfortunately recurs or persists. We cover them from 1 year after the date of diagnosis of each preceding Cancer which we have paid the Major Disease Benefit or Extended Major Disease Benefit, before they reach age 86 (ANB).

Once we have paid the Major Disease Benefit, the Early Stage Major Disease Benefit, Early Stage Critical Illness Premium Waiver Benefit, Intensive Care Benefit, Parental Premium Waiver Benefit, Death Benefit, Surrender Value, Special Bonus and Critical Illness Care Enhancer III are no longer available.

## How do I make multiple claims?

### Making a claim on Extended Major Disease Benefit

For us to pay the Extended Major Disease Benefit for the life assured under age 86 (ANB), they need to survive for at least 14 days from the date of diagnosis. They should also fulfil the “waiting period” and “making Extended Major Disease Benefit claim(s) for Prostate Cancer” requirements which we have explained in the “More about the plan” section later in the brochure.

### Making a claim for Early Stage Major Disease Benefit

There are also claim conditions requirements for a second claim on Carcinoma-in-situ and Coronary Angioplasty. We have outlined these in the “More about the plan” section later in the brochure.

# Special Protection to Your Family - Family Extra Benefit

To extend protection to your loved ones, when any 2 members of your family are both covered under the plan, this one-off benefit gives an additional 50% of the current sum assured under PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III to cover the death of the life assured within the first 10 years.

## How This Benefit Works

This benefit is eligible for the following 3 relationship groups:

- You take out the plan for yourself and your spouse
- You take out the plan for yourself and your child
- You take out the plan for your 2 children

### Case Example:

Mr. and Mrs. Tong are each the life assured of their own PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III policy, with a current sum assured of USD 120,000 and USD 180,000 respectively. In the first 10 years of their policies, they are both entitled to the plan’s Family Extra Benefit. This gives Mr. Tong or Mrs. Tong an extra 50% of their current sum assured if either of them unfortunately passes away.

| |PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III|Family Extra Benefit|
|---|---|---|
|Mr. Tong's Policy|Current Sum Assured: USD 120,000|Life Protection: USD 60,000|
|Mrs. Tong's Policy|Current Sum Assured: USD 180,000|Life Protection: USD 90,000|

You can find more about this benefit in the “Benefit schedule” and in the “More about the plan” sections below.

# Prudential HK Insurance Product

# Parental Premium Waiver Benefit

The plan helps you protect your child (as the life assured aged 1 – 18) when the plan comes into force, even if you are no longer able to, with a Parental Premium Waiver Benefit – without the need to give any health information. If you (or your spouse) are aged 19 – 51 when your plan comes into force, and unfortunately pass away before the premium term ends, we will waive the future basic premiums of your plan, starting from the next due premium, until the life assured reaches age 26 or the premium term ends, whichever is earlier. This ensures your loved ones’ protection stays in place, even when finances may be tight after the loss of a family breadwinner.

## Benefits:

- Premium waiver of 12 months after a major disease claim
- Waiver of all future premiums after a major disease claim

## How It Works:

To ease your financial burden when a critical disease strikes, we waive your premium payments at different stages of critical illness:

- Early Stage Critical Illness Premium Waiver Benefit: Once we have paid the Early Stage Major Disease Benefit, we will waive the premiums of your PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III due in the next 12 months.
- Critical Illness Premium Waiver Benefit: Once we have paid the Major Disease Benefit, we will waive all future premiums of your PRUHealth Critical Illness Extended Care III to give you continuous protection until the life assured reaches age 86.

## Risks:

Except for death caused by an accident, to be eligible for this benefit, the policy needs to have been in force for at least 2 years when you (or your spouse) unfortunately pass away.

## Coverage:

The plan covers disease conditions related to congenital diseases or developmental disorders, providing protection and long-term savings in one plan. It is a Shareholder-backed Participating Plan offering in-depth protection and long-term savings value.

## Supplementary Benefits:

You can choose from a range of supplementary benefits to extend your coverage by paying additional premiums to cover the life assured against extra medical expenses and accidents.

# Prudential HK Investment Philosophy

# Investment Philosophy

We aim to protect the rights and manage the reasonable expectations of all Shareholder-backed Participating policyholders. Our investment objective is to maximize policyholders’ returns with an acceptable level of risk through a broad mix of investments.

## Investment Strategy

The Shareholder-backed Participating Fund invests in various types of assets, such as equity-type securities and fixed-income securities to diversify investment risks. Equity-type securities aim to provide policyholders with the potential for a higher long-term return.

We adopt an actively managed investment strategy, adjusting it in response to changing market conditions. Our experts allocate a smaller proportion of higher-risk assets, such as equities, to insurance plans with a higher guarantee and a larger proportion of higher-risk assets to insurance plans with lower guarantees to match the level of risk to the risk profiles of our products. Derivatives may be utilized to manage risks or improve returns, and securities-lending may be used to enhance returns.

### Current Investment Mix

The current long-term target asset allocation is as follows:

|Asset type|Allocation (%)|
|---|---|
|Fixed-income securities|55%|
|Equity-type securities|45%|

Guaranteed liabilities to policyholders are mainly supported by fixed-income securities, primarily invested in fixed-income securities rated at least investment-grade. A small portion of high-yield and emerging-market bonds may be included for improved yield and diversification. For equity-type securities, most investments are in stocks listed on major international exchanges.

# Prudential HK - Currency Strategy

# Currency Strategy

Our currency strategy is to broadly match the fixed-income securities to the underlying policy denomination, while allowing more flexibility for equity-type securities for diversification. We may invest fixed-income securities in a currency other than the underlying policy denomination, and currency hedging may be used to reduce the currency risk.

We invest globally to achieve diversification benefits, with a higher relative allocation in the US and Asia, which is regularly reviewed. We actively manage and adjust actual exposure in response to changing market conditions and opportunities.

Given that asset values may vary due to changes in the economic environment and investment performance, the actual allocation may differ from the target allocation. We regularly review the investment mix to align with our investment objectives and risk appetite.

# Key Risks

# Key Risks

How may our credit risk affect your policy?

The guaranteed cash value (if applicable) and insurance benefit of your plan are subject to our credit risk. If we become insolvent, you may lose the value of your policy and its coverage.

How may currency exchange rate risk affect your benefits?

Foreign currency exchange rates may fluctuate. As a result, you may incur a substantial loss when you choose to convert your benefits to other currencies. Additionally, the conversion of your benefits to other currencies is subject to exchange restrictions applicable at the time when the benefits are paid. You have the sole responsibility to decide if you want to convert your benefits to other currencies.

What are the risks of surrendering your plan or withdrawing money from your plan?

The liquidity of an insurance policy is limited. You are strongly advised to reserve adequate liquid assets for emergencies. For any surrender/withdrawal especially at the early stage upon policy inception, you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid.

How may inflation affect the value of your plan?

We expect the cost of living to rise in the future because of inflation. That means the insurance you take out today will not have the same buying power in the future, even if the plan offers increasing benefit intended to offset inflation.

What happens if you do not pay your premiums?

You should only apply for this product if you intend to pay all of its premiums. If you miss any of your premium payments, we will automatically settle your outstanding premiums or premiums and levy(ies) by an automatic premium loan, with interest charged at a rate as determined by us. In the case the loan amount (plus accrued interest) exceeds the amount we allow for loan under the policy, we may terminate your policy and you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid, as well as losing the policy’s coverage.

Why may we adjust your premiums?

We have the right to review and adjust the plan’s premium rates for particular risk classes on each policy anniversary, but not for any individual customer. We may adjust premium rates because of several factors, such as our claims, investment, and persistency experience.

# Prudential HK - Tax Residence Information

# Tax Residence Information

According to the due diligence procedures set out in the Amendment Ordinance, self-certifications are required from account holders for all new accounts. As for pre-existing accounts, if a reporting financial institution has doubts about the tax residence of an account holder, it may require a self-certification from the account holder to verify its tax residence.

Prudential cannot provide you with any tax or legal advice. If you have doubts about your tax residence you should seek professional advice. You should seek independent professional advice on the impact that AEOI may have on you or your policy.

An account holder who knowingly or recklessly provides a statement that is misleading, false or incorrect in a material particular in making a self-certification to a reporting financial institution is liable on conviction to a fine at level 3 (HKD 10,000).
