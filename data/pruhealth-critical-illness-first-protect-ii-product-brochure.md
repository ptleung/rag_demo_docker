# Prudential HK Insurance Plan - PRUHealth Critical Illness First Protect II

# How does the plan work?

At age 30 (ANB), Ms. Chow enrolled in a 20-year payment term PRUHealth Critical Illness First Protect II as the life assured with a current sum assured of USD 100,000. In her first 10 policy years, she is entitled to Critical Illness First Enhancer II, which gives her extra protection of USD 50,000, i.e. 50% of her USD 100,000 current sum assured. In other words, with an annual premium of USD 2,197, she is able to get a total cover of USD 150,000 in the first 10 policy years.

Extra 50% protection from Critical Illness First Enhancer II for the first 10 years:

- Entitled to Early Stage Critical Illness
- Premium Waiver Benefit - Premium waived for the next year

|Age 30|Age 34|Age 37|Age 39 ANB|
|---|---|---|---|
|Diagnosed with Carcinoma-in-situ of Cervix Uteri|Diagnosed with Severe Pneumonia and stayed in an ICU located in HK for 3 consecutive days|Diagnosed with Liver Cancer| |
|Entitled to Early Stage Major Disease Benefit under PRUHealth Critical Illness First Protect II|Entitled to Intensive Care Benefit under PRUHealth Critical Illness First Protect II|Entitled to Major Disease Benefit under Critical Illness First Enhancer II| |
|We pay USD 25,000 (25% of current sum assured)|We pay USD 20,000 (20% of current sum assured)|We pay USD 50,000| |

Total benefit payout = USD 150,000 (that is 759% of the total premiums paid) + face value of Terminal Bonus (if any)

We assume in the above example that Ms. Chow is a non-smoker and the premium for each year is USD 2,197. She has paid her premium between ages 30 to 39 (ANB). Except age 34 (ANB) where we waived her premium, she has paid a total of USD 19,773 through the 10 years of her policy. We also assume that the definitions and claims requirements of the benefits are fulfilled, no policy loans or policy changes have been made and no Benefit Protector Option has been exercised. Levy is excluded from the annual premium mentioned in the above example.

# Prudential HK Investment Philosophy

# Investment Philosophy

We aim to protect the rights and manage the reasonable expectations of all Shareholder-backed Participating policyholders. Our investment objective is to maximize policyholders’ returns with an acceptable level of risk through a broad mix of investments.

## Investment Strategy

The Shareholder-backed Participating Fund invests in various types of assets, such as equity-type securities and fixed-income securities to diversify investment risks. The equity-type securities aim to provide policyholders with the potential for a higher long-term return.

We adopt an actively managed investment strategy, adjusting it in response to changing market conditions. Our experts allocate a smaller proportion of higher-risk assets, such as equities, to insurance plans with a higher guarantee and a larger proportion of higher-risk assets to insurance plans with lower guarantees to match the level of risk to the risk profiles of our products. Derivatives may be utilized to manage risks or improve returns, and securities-lending may be used to enhance returns.

## Current Investment Mix

The current long-term target asset allocation is as follows:

|Asset Type|Allocation (%)|
|---|---|
|Fixed-income securities|70%|
|Equity-type securities|30%|

Our guaranteed liabilities to policyholders are mainly supported by fixed-income securities, primarily invested in fixed-income securities rated at least investment-grade. A small portion of high-yield and emerging-market bonds may be included for improved yield and diversification.

For equity-type securities, most investments are in stocks listed on major international exchanges. Our currency strategy aims to match fixed-income securities to the underlying policy denomination, with more flexibility for equity-type securities for diversification. Currency hedging will be used to reduce currency risk when investing in fixed-income securities in a currency other than the underlying policy denomination.

We invest globally for diversification benefits, with a higher relative allocation in the US and Asia, subject to regular review. Actual exposure is actively managed and adjusted in response to changing market conditions and opportunities.

Given potential variations in asset values due to economic changes and investment performance, the actual allocation may differ from the target allocation. Regular reviews ensure alignment with investment objectives and risk appetite.

For more information on the investment mix, please refer to https://pruhk.co/investmentmix-en.

# Prudential HK Insurance Product Risks

# Key Risks

How may our credit risk affect your policy?

The guaranteed cash value (if applicable) and insurance benefit of your plan are subject to our credit risk. If we become insolvent, you may lose the value of your policy and its coverage.

How may currency exchange rate risk affect your benefits?

Foreign currency exchange rates may fluctuate. As a result, you may incur a substantial loss when you choose to convert your benefits to other currencies. Additionally, the conversion of your benefits to other currencies is subject to exchange restrictions applicable at the time when the benefits are paid. You have the sole responsibility to decide if you want to convert your benefits to other currencies.

What are the risks of surrendering your plan or withdrawing money from your plan?

The liquidity of an insurance policy is limited. You are strongly advised to reserve adequate liquid assets for emergencies. For any surrender/withdrawal, especially at the early stage upon policy inception, you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid.

How may inflation affect the value of your plan?

We expect the cost of living to rise in the future because of inflation. That means the insurance you take out today will not have the same buying power in the future, even if the plan offers increasing benefits intended to offset inflation.

What happens if you do not pay your premiums?

You should only apply for this product if you intend to pay all its premiums. If you miss any of your premium payments, we will automatically settle your outstanding premiums or premiums and levy(ies) by an automatic premium loan, with interest charged at a rate determined by us. In the case the loan amount (plus accrued interest) exceeds the amount we allow for loan under the policy, we may terminate your policy and you may receive an amount considerably less than the premiums you paid, as well as losing the policy’s coverage.

Why may we adjust your premiums?

We have the right to review and adjust the plan’s premium rates for particular risk classes on each policy anniversary, but not for any individual customer. We may adjust premium rates because of several factors, such as our claims, investment, and persistency experience.

# Prudential HK Insurance Information

# Important Information

## Suicide Clause

If the life assured commits suicide regardless of sane or insane within 1 year from the effective date of the policy or from the date of any reinstatement, whichever is later, the death benefit will be limited to a refund of the premiums paid without interest subject to the deduction of any amounts we have already paid and any indebtedness you owe us under the policy.

## Cancellation Right

A customer who has bought the life insurance plans has a right to cancel the policy within the cooling-off period and obtain a refund of any premium(s) and levy(ies) paid less any withdrawals. Provided that no claim has been made, the customer may cancel the policy by giving written notice to us within 21 calendar days immediately following either the day of delivery of (1) the policy or (2) the notice (informing the availability of the policy and expiry date of the cooling-off period) to the customer or his/her nominated representative, whichever is earlier. Such notice must be signed by the customer and received directly by Prudential Hong Kong Limited at 8/F, Prudential Tower, The Gateway, Harbour City, 21 Canton Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong within the cooling-off period.

The premium and levy will be refunded in the currency of premium and levy payment at the time of application for this policy. If the currency of premium and levy payment is not the same as the plan currency, the refundable premium and levy amount in plan currency under this policy will be converted to the currency of premium and levy payment at the prevailing currency exchange rate as determined by us in our absolute discretion from time to time upon payment. After the cooling-off period expires, if a customer cancels the policy before the end of benefit term, the actual cash value (if applicable) may be substantially less than the total amount of premiums paid.

## Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information

Over 100 countries and jurisdictions around the world have committed to adopt new rules for automatic exchange of financial account information (“AEOI”). Under the new rules, financial institutions are required to identify account holders who are foreign tax residents and report certain information regarding their investment income and account balance to the local tax authority where the financial institution operates. When countries or jurisdictions start exchanging information on an automatic basis, the relevant local tax authority where the financial account is maintained will then provide this information to the tax authority of the account holder’s country of tax residence. This information exchange will be conducted on a regular, annual basis.

Hong Kong has adopted the new rules into its legislation (please see the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 2016 (“the Amendment Ordinance”) which came into effect on 30 June 2016). Therefore, the above requirements will be applicable to financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential. Under these rules, certain policyholders of Prudential are considered as “account holders”. Financial institutions in Hong Kong including Prudential are required to implement due diligence procedures to identify account holders (i.e. policyholders in case where the financial institution is an insurance company) and in the case where the account holder is an entity, its “controlling persons”, who are foreign tax residents, and report this information to the Inland Revenue Department (“IRD”) if required. The IRD may transfer this information to the country of tax residence of such account holders.

In order to comply with the law, Prudential may require you, the account holder, to:

1. Complete and provide us with a self-certification form with information regarding your tax residence status, your tax identification number in your country or countries of tax residence, your date of birth, and in the case where the policyholder is an entity (for example, a trust or a company), the classification of the entity that holds the policy and information regarding “controlling persons” of such entities;
2. Provide us all required information and documentation for complying with Prudential’s due diligence procedures; and
3. Advise us of any change in circumstances which affect your tax residence status and provide us with a suitably updated self-certification form within 30 days of such change in circumstances.
---
# Prudential HK - Tax Residence Information

# Tax Residence Information

According to the due diligence procedures set out in the Amendment Ordinance, self-certifications are required from account holders for all new accounts. As for pre-existing accounts, if a reporting financial institution has doubts about the tax residence of an account holder, it may require a self-certification from the account holder to verify its tax residence.

Prudential cannot provide you with any tax or legal advice. If you have doubts about your tax residence you should seek professional advice. You should seek independent professional advice on the impact that AEOI may have on you or your policy.

An account holder who knowingly or recklessly provides a statement that is misleading, false or incorrect in a material particular in making a self-certification to a reporting financial institution is liable on conviction to a fine at level 3 (HKD 10,000).

For further information on the implementation of the Common Reporting Standard and AEOI in Hong Kong, please refer to the IRD website: www.ird.gov.hk/eng/tax/dta_aeoi.htm.
